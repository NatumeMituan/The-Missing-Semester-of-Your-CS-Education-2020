## Shell scripting

- About shell scripting
    - Most shells have their own scripting language with variables, control flow and its own syntax. bash supports control flow techniques including `if`, `case`, `while`, `for`.
    - What makes shell scripting different from other (general purpose) scripting programming language is that it is optimized for performing shell-related tasks like creating command pipelines, saving results into files, and reading from standard input.
    - The lecture focuses on bash scripting since it is the most common.
    - Writing bash scripts can be tricky and unintuitive. There are tools like [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) that will help you find errors in your sh/bash scripts.
- Assign and access variable
    
    ```bash
    foo=bar
    echo "$foo"
    # prints bar
    echo '$foo'
    # prints $foo
    ```
    
    - `foo=bar`: Assign the variable `foo` with string `bar`
    - `foo = bar`: Won’t work, it will be interpreted as calling the `foo` program with arguments `=` and `bar` (In general, in shell scripts the space character will perform argument splitting)
    - `$foo`: Access the variable `foo`
    - `'`: Literal strings
    - `"`: Substitute variable values
- Function
    
    ```bash
    mcd () {
        mkdir -p "$1"
        cd "$1"
    }
    ```
    
    Bash uses a variety of special variables to refer to arguments, error codes, and other relevant variables. Below is a list of some of them. A more comprehensive list 
    can be found [here](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/special-chars.html).
    
    - `$0`: Name of the script
    - `$1` to `$9`: Arguments to the script. `$1` is the first argument and so on.
    - `$@`: All the arguments
    - `$#`: Number of arguments
    - `$?`: Return code of the previous command
    - `$$`: Process identification number (PID) for the current script
    - `!!`: Entire last command, including arguments. A common pattern is to execute a command only for it to fail due to missing permissions; you can
    quickly re-execute the command with sudo by doing `sudo !!`
    - `$_`: Last argument from the last command. If you are in an interactive shell, you can also quickly get this value by typing `Esc` followed by `.` or `Alt+.`
    
- Return code
    
    ```bash
    false || echo "Oops, fail"
    # Oops, fail
    
    true || echo "Will not be printed"
    #
    
    true && echo "Things went well"
    # Things went well
    
    false && echo "Will not be printed"
    #
    
    true ; echo "This will always run"
    # This will always run
    
    false ; echo "This will always run"
    # This will always run
    ```
    
    - Commands will often return output using `STDOUT`, errors through `STDERR`, and a Return Code to report errors in a more script-friendly manner.
    - The return code (or exit status) is the way scripts/commands have to communicate how execution went. A value of 0 usually means everything went OK; anything different from 0 means an error occurred.
    - The return codes can be used to conditionally execute commands using `&&` (and operator) and `||` (or operator), both of which are [short-circuiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation) operators.
    - The `true` program will always have a `0` return code and the `false` command will always have a `1` return code.
    - Commands can also be separated within the same line using a semicolon `;`.
- Command substitution and process substitution
    - `$(CMD)`: Command substitution
        - It will execute `CMD` and substitute the output in place.
        - E.g. `for file in $(ls)` will first call `ls` and then iterate over those values.
    - `<(CMD)`: Process substitution
        - It will execute `CMD` and substitute the output in a temporary file.
        - Useful when commands expect values to be passed by **file** instead of by `STDIN`.
        - E.g. `diff <(ls foo) <(ls bar)` will show differences between files in directories  `foo` and `bar`.
    - E.g.
        
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        
        echo "Starting program at $(date)" # Date will be substituted
        
        echo "Running program $0 with $# arguments with pid $$"
        
        for file in "$@"; do
            # When pattern is not found, grep has exit status 1
            # We redirect STDOUT and STDERR to a null register
        		# since we do not care about them
            grep foobar "$file" > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
        		# -ne means not equal
            if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
                echo "File $file does not have any foobar, adding one"
                echo "# foobar" >> "$file"
            fi
        done
        ```
        
        - The script will iterate through the arguments we provide, look for the string `foobar`, and append it to the file as a comment if not found.
        - `$? -ne 0`: Test whether `$?` was not equal to 0. Detailed list for comparisons in bash:
        manual page for [test](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/test.1.html).
        - When performing comparisons in bash, try to use double brackets `[[ ]]` in favor of simple brackets `[ ]`. Chances of making mistakes are lower although it won’t be portable to `sh`. A more detailed explanation can be found [here](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031).
- `glob` ([global](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)))
    - Wildcards
        - `?`: Matches any single character
        - `*`: Matches any number of any characters including none
    - Curly braces `{}`: Expand the substrings
    
    ```bash
    convert image.{png,jpg}
    # Will expand to
    convert image.png image.jpg
    
    cp /path/to/project/{foo,bar,baz}.sh /newpath
    # Will expand to
    cp /path/to/project/foo.sh /path/to/project/bar.sh /path/to/project/baz.sh /newpath
    
    # Globbing techniques can also be combined
    mv *{.py,.sh} folder
    # Will move all *.py and *.sh files
    
    mkdir foo bar
    # This creates files foo/a, foo/b, ... foo/h, bar/a, bar/b, ... bar/h
    touch {foo,bar}/{a..h}
    touch foo/x bar/y
    # Show differences between files in foo and bar
    diff <(ls foo) <(ls bar)
    # Outputs
    # < x
    # ---
    # > y
    ```
    
- [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) (sharp-bang)
    
    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import sys
    for arg in reversed(sys.argv[1:]):
        print(arg)
    ```
    
    - Scripts need not necessarily be written in bash to be called from the terminal.
    - A [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) line at the top of the script is required for the kernel knows how to execute it.
    - To increase the portability of your scripts, write shebang lines using the `[env](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/env.1.html)` command that will resolve the location of the command making use of the `PATH` environment variable.
    
- Some differences between shell functions and scripts
    - Functions have to be in the same language as the shell, while
    scripts can be written in any language. This is why including a shebang
    for scripts is important.
    - Functions are loaded once when their definition is read. Scripts
    are loaded every time they are executed. This makes functions slightly
    faster to load, but whenever you change them you will have to reload
    their definition (by `source a.sh`).
    - Functions are executed in the current shell environment whereas
    scripts execute in their own process. Thus, functions can modify
    environment variables, e.g. change your current directory, whereas
    scripts can’t. Scripts will be passed by value environment variables
    that have been exported using `[export](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/export.1p.html)`
    - As with any programming language, functions are a powerful
    construct to achieve modularity, code reuse, and clarity of shell code.
    Often shell scripts will include their own function definitions.

## Shell tools

- Finding how to use commands
    1. `-h` or `--help`
    2. `man command` (manpage, short for manual page) for more detailed information
        - [Online version of the linux manpage](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html)
        - Non-native commands that you install will have manpage entries if the developer wrote them and included them as part of the installation process.
        - Interactive tools such as the ones based on ncurses, help for the commands can often be accessed within the program using the `:help` command or typing `?`.
    3. `[tldr` pages](https://tldr.sh/) for example use cases contributed by the community
- Finding files
    - `find`
        - All UNIX-like systems come packaged with `[find](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html)`, which will recursively search for files matching some criteria.
        - `-name ‘*PATTERN*”`: Find the name match the pattern
        - `-iname`: Case insensitive
        
        ```bash
        # Find all directories named src
        find . -name src -type d
        # Find all python files that have a folder named test in their path
        find . -path '*/test/*.py' -type f
        # Find all files modified in the last day
        find . -mtime -1
        # Find all zip files with size in range 500k to 10M
        find . -size +500k -size -10M -name '*.tar.gz'
        
        # Delete all files with .tmp extension
        find . -name '*.tmp' -exec rm {} \;
        # Find all PNG files and convert them to JPG
        find . -name '*.png' -exec convert {} {}.jpg \;
        ```
        
    - `fd`
        - [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) is a simple, fast, and user-friendly alternative to `find`.
        - It offers some nice defaults like colorized output, default regex matching, and Unicode support. It also has a more intuitive syntax.
        - `fd PATTERN`: Find the name match the pattern
        
    - `locate`
        - [locate](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/locate.1.html) uses a database updated using `[updatedb](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/updatedb.1.html)`.
        - In most systems, `updatedb` is updated daily via `[cron](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/cron.8.html)`.
        - Prons: speed, cons: freshness
        - Moreover `find` and similar tools can also find files using attributes such as file size, modification time, or file permissions, while `locate` just uses the file name.
        - A more in-depth comparison can be found [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/60205/locate-vs-find-usage-pros-and-cons-of-each-other)
- Finding code
    - `grep`
        - `-C`: Getting **C**ontext around the matching line
            - E.g. `grep -C 5`: print 5 lines before and after the match
        - `-v`: In**v**erting the match, i.e. print all lines that do **not** match the pattern
        - `-R`: **R**ecursively go into directories and look for files for the matching string
    - `rp` (ripgrep)
        - There are many `grep` alternatives including [ack](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3), [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) and [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).
        
        ```bash
        # Find all python files where I used the requests library
        rg -t py 'import requests'
        # Find all files (including hidden files) without a shebang line
        rg -u --files-without-match "^#!"
        # Find all matches of foo and print the following 5 lines
        rg foo -A 5
        # Print statistics of matches (# of matched lines and files )
        rg --stats PATTERN
        ```
        
- Finding shell commands
    - Up arrow: Go through your shell history
    - `history`: Print your shell history to standard output
        - E.g. `history | grep mkdir`: print historical commands containing string `mkdir`.
    - `ctrl + r`: Search in the history
        - This can also be enabled with the UP/DOWN arrows in [zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search).
        - Bind it with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Configuring-shell-key-bindings#ctrl-r). `fzf` is a general-purpose fuzzy finder that can be used with many commands. Here it is used to fuzzily match through your history and present results in a convenient and visually pleasing manner.
    - history-based autosuggestions
        - First introduced by the [fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell, this feature dynamically autocompletes your current shell command with the most recent command that you typed that shares a common prefix with it.
        - Can be enabled in [zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions).
        - You can modify your shell’s history behavior, like preventing commands with a leading space from being included. This comes in handy when you are typing commands with passwords or other bits of sensitive information. To do this, add `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace` to your `.bashrc` or `setopt HIST_IGNORE_SPACE` to your `.zshrc`. If you make the mistake of not adding the leading space, you can always manually remove the entry by editing your `.bash_history` or `.zhistory`.
        .
- Directory navigation
    - Quickly navigating directories
        - Simple ways
            - Write shell aliases
            - Create symlinks using `ln -s`
        - Finding frequent and/or recent files and directories
            - `fasd` and `autojump`
                - [Fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd) ranks files and directories by *[frecency](https://web.archive.org/web/20210421120120/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/Frecency_algorithm)* (both *frequency*
                 and *recency).*
                - By default, `fasd` adds a `z` command that you can use to quickly `cd` using a substring of a *frecent* directory.
                    - E.g. `z cool` to jump to `/home/user/files/cool_project`
                    - For [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump): `j cool`
                    
    - Get an overview of a directory structure: `[tree](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree)`, `[broot](https://github.com/Canop/broot)`
    - Full fledged file managers: `[nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn)`,  `[ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)`

## Exercises

1. Read `[man ls](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html)` and write an `ls` command that lists files in the following manner
    - Includes all files, including hidden files
    - Sizes are listed in human readable format (e.g. 454M instead of 454279954)
    - Files are ordered by recency
    - Output is colorized
    
    A sample output would look like this
    
    ```bash
     -rw-r--r--   1 user group 1.1M Jan 14 09:53 baz
     drwxr-xr-x   5 user group  160 Jan 14 09:53 .
     -rw-r--r--   1 user group  514 Jan 14 06:42 bar
     -rw-r--r--   1 user group 106M Jan 13 12:12 foo
     drwx------+ 47 user group 1.5K Jan 12 18:08 ..
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # -a == -all
    # -h == --human-readable
    ls -l -a -h -t --color=always
    ```
    
2. Write bash functions `marco` and `polo` that do the following. Whenever you execute `marco` the current working directory should be saved in some manner, then when you execute `polo`, no matter what directory you are in, `polo` should `cd` you back to the directory where you executed `marco`. For ease of debugging you can write the code in a file `marco.sh` and (re)load the definitions to your shell by executing `source marco.sh`.
    
    ```bash
    marco () {
        echo $(pwd) > ~/marco.txt
    }
    
    polo (){
        cd $(cat ~/marco.txt)
    }
    ```
    
3. Say you have a command that fails rarely. In order to debug it you need to capture its output but it can be time consuming to get a failure run. Write a bash script that runs the following script until it fails and captures its standard output and error streams to files and prints
everything at the end. Bonus points if you can also report how many runs it took for the script to fail.
    
    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    
     n=$(( RANDOM % 100 ))
    
     if [[ n -eq 42 ]]; then
        echo "Something went wrong"
        >&2 echo "The error was using magic numbers"
        exit 1
     fi
    
     echo "Everything went according to plan"
    ```
    
    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    
    cnt=0
    
    while true
    do
        let cnt++
        bash a.sh > ~/a.standard-out 2>~/a.error-out
    
        if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
            cat ~/a.standard-out ~/a.error-out
            echo $cnt
            exit 0
        fi
    done
    ```
    
4. As we covered in the lecture `find`’s `-exec` can be very powerful for performing operations over the files we are searching for. However, what if we want to do something with **all** the files, like creating a zip file? As you have seen so far commands will take input from both arguments and STDIN. When piping commands, we are connecting STDOUT to STDIN, but some commands like `tar` take inputs from arguments. To bridge this disconnect there’s the `[xargs](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/xargs.1.html)` command which will execute a command using STDIN as arguments. For example `ls | xargs rm` will delete the files in the current directory.
    
    Your task is to write a command that recursively finds all HTML files in the folder and makes a zip with them. Note that your command should work even if the files have spaces (hint: check `-d` flag for `xargs`).
    
    If you’re on macOS, note that the default BSD `find` is different from the one included in [GNU coreutils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_Core_Utilities_commands). You can use `-print0` on `find` and the `-0` flag on `xargs`. As a macOS user, you should be aware that command-line utilities shipped with macOS may differ from the GNU counterparts; you can install the GNU versions if you like by [using brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/coreutils).
    
    ```bash
    # -print0 uses a null character to split file names and
    # -0 uses it as delimiter
    # -v explains what is being done by rm
    
    find . -name '*.cs' -print0 | xargs -0 rm -v
    ```
    
5. (Advanced) Write a command or script to recursively find the most recently modified file in a directory. More generally, can you list all files by recency?
    
    ```bash
    # print the files with time
    # and sort them
    # -n compares strings according to string numerical value
    # -r reverses the result of comparisons
    
    find -printf "%TY-%Tm-%Td %TT %p\n" | sort -n -r
    ```
