## What is shell?

- The shell is a textual interface that allows you to run programs, give them input, and inspect their output in a semi-structured way.
- The terminal is a wrapper program that runs a shell and allows us to enter commands.

- This lecture focuses on [bash (Bourne Again SHell)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) (For Unix).
- Run `echo $SHELL`, If it says something like `/bin/bash` or `/usr/bin/zsh`, that means you’re running the right program.

## Run commands in the shell

- A shell prompt often looks like
    
    ```bash
    user@missing:~$
    ```
    
    - `user`: The user name
    - `missing`: The machine name
    - `~`: Short for `home`, your current working directory
    - `$`: You arre not the root user
- `$PATH`: How the shell find the programs?
    - The shell is a programming environment, and so it has variables, conditionals, loops, and functions. When you run commands in your shell, you are really writing a small bit of code that your shell interprets.
    - If the shell is asked to execute a command that doesn’t match one of its programming keywords, it consults an *environment variable* called `$PATH`that lists which directories the shell should search for programs when it is given a command:
    - When we run the `echo` command, the shell sees that it should execute the program `echo`, and then searches through the `:`-separated list of directories in `$PATH`f or a file by that name and runs it if found.
    - We can also bypass `$PATH` entirely by giving the *path* to the file we want to execute.
    
    ```bash
    missing:~$ echo $PATH
    /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
    missing:~$ which echo
    /bin/echo
    missing:~$ /bin/echo $PATH
    /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
    ```
    
- Arguments, flags and options
    - Arguments
        - The shell parses the command by splitting it by **whitespace**, and then runs the program indicated by the **first** word, supplying each subsequent word as an **argument** that the program can access.
    - Flags and options (flags with values)
        - Starts with `-` to modify the behavior of the command
            - `-h`: `-` for one character
            - `--help`: `--` for more characters
    - Eg for arguments and options.
        
        ```bash
        chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...
        ```
        
        `[]` stands for optional, `...` stands for zero or more
        
- Escape and quoting
    - To provide an argument that contains spaces or other special characters (e.g., “My Photos”)
        - Quote the argument with `'`or `"` (`"My Photos"`), or
        - Escape the relevant characters with `\` (`My\ Photos`)
    - `#` starts a comment in Bash
    - `!` has a special meaning even within double-quoted (`"`) strings. `'` quotiung preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes while `"` has some exceptions. See [Quoting](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Quoting.html).
        - So if you want to write sth like `#!/bin/sh` into a file, you need to do
            
            ```bash
            echo '#!/bin/sh' > file
            ```
            
        
- The path of the file system
    - A path on the shell is a delimited list of directories; separated by
        - `/` on Linux and macOS. The path `/` is the “root” of the file system, under which all directories and files lie. (This lecture assume you are using Linux)
        - `\` on Windows. There is one root for each disk partition (e.g., `C:\`).
    - A path that starts with `/` is called an *absolute* path.
    - Any other path is a *relative* path (relative to the current working directory).
    - `.` : The current directory in a path
    - `..` : The parent directory of the current directory in a path
    - `~`: The `home` path
    - In general, when we run a program, it will operate in the current directory unless we tell it otherwise.

## Handy **commands**

- `clear`: Clear the terminal (`Ctrl` + `l`)
- `man` (manul)
    
    It takes the name of a program as an argument.
    
    Press `q` to quit.
    
    ```bash
    missing:~$ man ls
    ```
    
- `which`: Find out which file is executed for a given program name
- `date`: Print the current date and time.
    
    ```bash
    missing:~$ date
    Fri 10 Jan 2020 11:49:31 AM EST
    missing:~$
    ```
    
- `echo`: Print its arguments.
    
    ```bash
    missing:~$ echo hello
    hello
    ```
    
- `pwd` , `cd` : Print / change current working directory
    - `pwd` (print working directory)
    - `cd` (change directory)
        - `cd -`: switch between current and previous directories
        - `cd`: equals to `cd ~`
    
    ```bash
    missing:~$ pwd
    /home/missing
    missing:~$ cd /home
    missing:/home$ pwd
    /home
    missing:/home$ cd ..
    missing:/$ pwd
    /
    missing:/$ cd ./home
    missing:/home$ pwd
    /home
    missing:/home$ cd missing
    missing:~$ pwd
    /home/missing
    missing:~$ ../../bin/echo hello
    hello
    ```
    
- `ls` (list): Print what lives in the given directory
    - `ls`
        
        ```bash
        missing:~$ ls
        missing:~$ cd ..
        missing:/home$ ls
        missing
        missing:/home$ cd ..
        missing:/$ ls
        bin
        boot
        dev
        etc
        home
        ...
        ```
        
    - `ls -l`: use a long listing format
        
        ```bash
        missing:~$ ls -l /home
        drwxr-xr-x 1 missing  users  4096 Jun 15  2019 missing
        ```
        
        - Permissions
            
            
            | Permissions | r | w | x | - |
            | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
            | File | read | write | excute | None |
            | Directory | lists the contents in it | add/remove the contents in it | search and enter it | None |
        - 1st column: The permissions
            - 1st column: `d` indicates it’s a directory
            - Next 3 columns: permissions of the owner (`missing`)
            - Next 3 columns: permissions of the owning group (`users`)
            - Next 3 columns: permissions of everyone else
        - 3rd column (`missing`): The owner
        - 4th column (`userss`): The owning group
        - Nearly all the files in `/bin` have the `x` permission set for the last group, “everyone else”, so that anyone can execute those programs.
- `mv` (move): Move / rename a file
- `cp` (copy): Copy a file
- `rm` (remove): Remove a file (or directory)
    - `rm -r`: Remove a directory **r**ecursively
- `touch` : Update the access and modification time of the file (a new file will be created if not exits)
- `chmod` (change mode): Change the access mode of the file
    - Format of the mode: `[ugoa...][[-+=][perms...]...]`
    
    ```bash
    # Add excute to the owner
    chmod u+x ./file
    ```
    
- `mkdir` (make directory): Make a new directory
- `cat` (concatenate):
    - When given file names as arguments, it prints the contents of each of the files in sequence to its output stream.
    - But when not given any arguments, it prints contents from its input stream to its output stream
- `curl` (client URL): Transfer data using various network protocols
- `grep` (**g**lobally search for a **r**egular **e**xpression and **p**rint matching lines): Search plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression
- `cut`: Remove sections from each line of files
- `tee` (T): Write the input to both standard output and one or more files
    
    ![]()![Untitled](/md.img/1.%20The%20Shell/Untitled.png)
    
- `xdg-open` (**Cross**-**D**esktop **G**roup-open): Open the file or url in the user's preferred application

## **Connecting programs**

- In the shell, programs have two primary “streams” associated with them: input and output stream. Normally, a program’s input and output are both your terminal (your keyboard as input and your screen as output). However, we can also rewire those streams.
- `>` and `<`: The simplest form of redirection
    
    ```bash
    missing:~$ echo hello > hello.txt
    missing:~$ cat hello.txt
    hello
    missing:~$ cat < hello.txt
    hello
    missing:~$ cat < hello.txt > hello2.txt
    missing:~$ cat hello2.txt
    hello
    ```
    
    - `command > outfile`: redirect the output stream
        - `>`: overwrite
        - `>>`: append
    - `command < infile`: redirect the input stream
    
- `|`: pipes: chain programs such that the output of one is the input of another
    
    ```bash
    missing:~$ ls -l / | tail -n1
    drwxr-xr-x 1 root  root  4096 Jun 20  2019 var
    missing:~$ curl --head --silent google.com | grep --ignore-case content-length | cut --delimiter=' ' -f2
    219
    ```
    

## Root user

- The root user is above (almost) all access restrictions, and can create, read, update, and delete any file in the system.
- You will not usually log into your system as the root user though, since it’s too easy to accidentally break something.
- `sudo` (**do** sth as a **s**uper **u**ser)
    
    ```bash
    $ sudo find -L /sys/class -maxdepth 2 -name '*timeout*'
    /sys/class/firmware/timeout
    $ cd /sys/class/firmware
    $ cat timeout
    60
    $ sudo echo 61 > timeout
    bash: timeout: Permission denied
    ```
    
    - The permission denied error is because of
        - `>` (also `<` and `|`) is done by the shell, not the `echo` command
        - The shell doesn’t run as a root user
    - Workarounds:
        - `sudo su`
            
            ```bash
            user@missing:/sys/class/firmware$ sudo su
            root@missing:/sys/class/firmware# cat timeout
            60
            root@missing:/sys/class/firmware# echo 61 > timeout
            root@missing:/sys/class/firmware# cat timeout
            61
            root@missing:/sys/class/firmware# exit
            exit
            user@missing:/sys/class/firmware$ cat timeout
            61
            ```
            
            - Get you a shell as a super user
                - The `user` changed to `root`
                - The `$` changed to `#` which stands for the root user
            - Could often be somewhat dangerous
        - `$ echo 61 | sudo tee timeout`
            
            ```bash
            user@missing:/sys/class/firmware$ echo 61 | sudo tee timeout
            61
            user@missing:/sys/class/firmware$ cat timeout
            61
            ```
            
            - No need to drop into a root shell
            

## Exercises

1. For this course, you need to be using a Unix shell like Bash or ZSH. If you are on Linux or macOS, you don’t have to do anything special. If you are on Windows, you need to make sure you are not running cmd.exe or PowerShell; you can use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or a Linux virtual machine to use Unix-style command-line tools. To make sure you’re running an appropriate shell, you can try the command `echo $SHELL`. If it says something like `/bin/bash` or `/usr/bin/zsh`, that means you’re running the right program.
2. Create a new directory called `missing` under `/tmp`.
    
    ```bash
    mkdir /tmp/missing
    ```
    
3. Look up the `touch` program. The `man` program is your friend.
    
    ```bash
    man touch
    ```
    
4. Use `touch` to create a new file called `semester` in `missing`.
    
    ```bash
    touch semester
    ```
    
5. Write the following into that file, one line at a time:
    
    `#!/bin/sh
    curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu`
    
    The first line might be tricky to get working. It’s helpful to know that `#` starts a comment in Bash, and `!` has a special meaning even within double-quoted (`"`) strings. Bash treats single-quoted strings (`'`) differently: they will do the trick in this case. See the Bash [quoting](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Quoting.html) manual page for more information.
    
    ```bash
    $ echo '#!/bin/sh' > semester 
    $ echo 'curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu' >> semester
    $ cat semester 
    #!/bin/sh
    curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu
    ```
    
6. Try to execute the file, i.e. type the path to the script (`./semester`) into your shell and press enter. Understand why it doesn’t work by consulting the output of `ls` (hint: look at the permission bits of the file).
    
    ```bash
    $ ./semester
    bash: ./semester: Permission denied
    $ ls semester -l
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 mituan mituan 61 Aug 19 12:20 semester
    ```
    
    There’s no excute permission (`x`) for the file.
    
7. Run the command by explicitly starting the `sh` interpreter, and giving it the file `semester` as the first argument, i.e. `sh semester`. Why does this work, while `./semester` didn’t?
    
    ```bash
    $ sh semester
    HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established
    
    HTTP/2 200 
    server: GitHub.com
    content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    last-modified: Sat, 14 May 2022 10:50:11 GMT
    ...
    
    $ which sh
    /usr/bin/sh
    $ ls /usr/bin/sh -l
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 May  6 00:02 /usr/bin/sh -> dash
    ```
    
    The `sh` command (`usr/bin/sh`) is executable.
    
8. Look up the `chmod` program (e.g. use `man chmod`).
9. Use `chmod` to make it possible to run the command `./semester` rather than having to type `sh semester`. How does your shell know that the file is supposed to be interpreted using `sh`? See this page on the [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) line for more information.
    
    ```bash
    $ chmod u+x semester 
    $ ./semester
    HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established
    
    HTTP/2 200 
    server: GitHub.com
    content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    last-modified: Sat, 14 May 2022 10:50:11 GMT
    ...
    ```
    
10. Use `|` and `>` to write the “last modified” date output by `semester` into a file called `last-modified.txt` in your home directory.
    
    ```bash
    $ ./semester | grep --ignore-case last-modified | cut --delimiter=' ' -f2- > ~/last-modified.txt
    $ cat ~/last-modified.txt 
    Sat, 14 May 2022 10:50:11 GMT
    ```
    
11. Write a command that reads out your laptop battery’s power level or your desktop machine’s CPU temperature from `/sys`. Note: if you’re a macOS user, your OS doesn’t have sysfs, so you can skip this exercise.
