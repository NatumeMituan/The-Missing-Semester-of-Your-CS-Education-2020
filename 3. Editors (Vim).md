## ****Philosophy of Vim****

- Vim is a modal editor: different models for inserting text vs mainpulating text, since most of our time is spent on reading, navigating and making small edits, instead of writing long stream of text.
- Vim is programmbale: with Vimscript, other languages like Python, and also Vim’s interface itself is a programming language.
- Vim avoids using mouse or the arrow keys: they require too much movement and hence too slow.

The end result is an deitor taht can match the speed at which you think.

## Buffers, tabs, and windows

- Buffers: a set of open files
- Tabs: a vim session has a number of tabs
- Windows: each tab has a number of windows (split panes)

A given buffer may be open in multiple windows.

## Modal editing

### Different models in Vim

- **Normal** (default, `ESC`): for moving around a file and making edits
- **Insert** (`i`): for inserting text
- **Replace** (`R`): for replacing text
- **Visual** (plain (`v`), line (`V`), or block (`Ctrl-v`)): for selecting blocks of text
- **Command-line** (`:`): for running a command

The Normal mode is the default mode. You type different keys to enter different modes in Normal mode, and type `<ECS>` to return to the Normal mode.

You use the `<ESC>` key a lot when using Vim: consider remapping Caps Lock to Escape ([macOS instructions](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Map_caps_lock_to_escape_in_macOS)).

### Command-line mode

- `:q` quit (close window)
    - `:qa` quit all (close all windows)
- `:w` save (“write”)
- `:wq` save and quit
- `:e {name of file}` open file for editing
- `:ls` show open buffers
- `:help {topic}` open help
    - `:help :w` opens help for the `:w` command
    - `:help w` opens help for the `w` movement

### ****Vim’s interface is a programming language****

- Movement
    
    You should spend most of your time in Normal mode, using movement commands to navigate the buffer. Movements in Vim are also called “nouns”, because they refer to chunks of text.
    
    - Basic movement: `hjkl` (left, down, up, right)
    - Words: `w` (next word), `b` (beginning of word), `e` (end of word)
    - Lines: `0` (beginning of line), `^` (first non-blank character), `$` (end of line)
    - Screen: `H` (top of screen), `M` (middle of screen), `L` (bottom of screen)
    - Scroll: `Ctrl-u` (up), `Ctrl-d` (down)
    - File: `gg` (beginning of file), `G` (end of file)
    - Line numbers: `:{number}<CR>` or `{number}G` (line {number})
    - Misc: `%` (corresponding item)
    - Find: `f{character}`, `t{character}`, `F{character}`, `T{character}`
        - find/to forward/backward {character} on the current line
        - `,` / `;` for navigating matches
    - Search: `/{regex}`, `n` / `N` for navigating matches
    
- Selection
    
    Visual modes:
    
    - Visual: `v`
    - Visual Line: `V`
    - Visual Block: `Ctrl-v`
    
    Can use movement keys to make selection.
    
- Edits
    
    Everything that you used to do with the mouse, you now do with the keyboard using editing commands that compose with movement commands. Here’s where Vim’s interface starts to look like a programming language. Vim’s editing commands are also called “verbs”, because verbs act on nouns.
    
    - `i` enter Insert mode
        - but for manipulating/deleting text, want to use something more than backspace
    - `o` / `O` insert line below / above
    - `d{motion}` delete {motion}
        - e.g. `dw` is delete word, `d$` is delete to end of line, `d0` is delete to beginning of line
    - `c{motion}` change {motion}
        - e.g. `cw` is change word
        - like `d{motion}` followed by `i`
    - `x` delete character (equal do `dl`)
    - `s` substitute character (equal to `cl`)
    - Visual mode + manipulation
        - select text, `d` to delete it or `c` to change it
    - `u` to undo, `<C-r>` to redo
    - `y` to copy / “yank” (some other commands like `d` also copy)
    - `p` to paste
    - Lots more to learn: e.g. `~` flips the case of a character
    
- Counts
    
    You can combine nouns and verbs with a count, which will perform a given action a number of times.
    
    - `3w` move 3 words forward
    - `5j` move 5 lines down
    - `7dw` delete 7 words
- ****Modifiers****
    
    You can use modifiers to change the meaning of a noun. Some modifiers are `i`, which means “inner” or “inside”, and `a`, which means “around”.
    
    - `ci(` change the contents inside the current pair of parentheses
    - `ci[` change the contents inside the current pair of square brackets
    - `da'` delete a single-quoted string, including the surrounding single quotes
    

## Customzing Vim

Vim is customized through a plain-text configuration file in `~/.vimrc` (containing Vimscript commands). There are probably lots of basic settings that you want to turn on.

We are providing a well-documented basic config that you can use as a starting point. We recommend using this because it fixes some of Vim’s quirky default behavior. **Download our config [here](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/files/vimrc) and save it to `~/.vimrc`.**

Vim is heavily customizable, and it’s worth spending time exploring customization options. You can look at people’s dotfiles on GitHub for inspiration, for example, your instructors’ Vim configs ([Anish](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc), [Jon](https://github.com/jonhoo/configs/blob/master/editor/.config/nvim/init.vim) (uses [neovim](https://neovim.io/)), [Jose](https://github.com/JJGO/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/.vimrc)). There are lots of good blog posts on this topic too. Try not to copy-and-paste people’s full configuration, but read it, understand it, and take what you need.

- The provided config to start:
    
    ```
    " Comments in Vimscript start with a `"`.
    
    " If you open this file in Vim, it'll be syntax highlighted for you.
    
    " Vim is based on Vi. Setting `nocompatible` switches from the default
    " Vi-compatibility mode and enables useful Vim functionality. This
    " configuration option turns out not to be necessary for the file named
    " '~/.vimrc', because Vim automatically enters nocompatible mode if that file
    " is present. But we're including it here just in case this config file is
    " loaded some other way (e.g. saved as `foo`, and then Vim started with
    " `vim -u foo`).
    set nocompatible
    
    " Turn on syntax highlighting.
    syntax on
    
    " Disable the default Vim startup message.
    set shortmess+=I
    
    " Show line numbers.
    set number
    
    " This enables relative line numbering mode. With both number and
    " relativenumber enabled, the current line shows the true line number, while
    " all other lines (above and below) are numbered relative to the current line.
    " This is useful because you can tell, at a glance, what count is needed to
    " jump up or down to a particular line, by {count}k to go up or {count}j to go
    " down.
    set relativenumber
    
    " Always show the status line at the bottom, even if you only have one window open.
    set laststatus=2
    
    " The backspace key has slightly unintuitive behavior by default. For example,
    " by default, you can't backspace before the insertion point set with 'i'.
    " This configuration makes backspace behave more reasonably, in that you can
    " backspace over anything.
    set backspace=indent,eol,start
    
    " By default, Vim doesn't let you hide a buffer (i.e. have a buffer that isn't
    " shown in any window) that has unsaved changes. This is to prevent you from "
    " forgetting about unsaved changes and then quitting e.g. via `:qa!`. We find
    " hidden buffers helpful enough to disable this protection. See `:help hidden`
    " for more information on this.
    set hidden
    
    " This setting makes search case-insensitive when all characters in the string
    " being searched are lowercase. However, the search becomes case-sensitive if
    " it contains any capital letters. This makes searching more convenient.
    set ignorecase
    set smartcase
    
    " Enable searching as you type, rather than waiting till you press enter.
    set incsearch
    
    " Unbind some useless/annoying default key bindings.
    nmap Q <Nop> " 'Q' in normal mode enters Ex mode. You almost never want this.
    
    " Disable audible bell because it's annoying.
    set noerrorbells visualbell t_vb=
    
    " Enable mouse support. You should avoid relying on this too much, but it can
    " sometimes be convenient.
    set mouse+=a
    
    " Try to prevent bad habits like using the arrow keys for movement. This is
    " not the only possible bad habit. For example, holding down the h/j/k/l keys
    " for movement, rather than using more efficient movement commands, is also a
    " bad habit. The former is enforceable through a .vimrc, while we don't know
    " how to prevent the latter.
    " Do this in normal mode...
    nnoremap <Left>  :echoe "Use h"<CR>
    nnoremap <Right> :echoe "Use l"<CR>
    nnoremap <Up>    :echoe "Use k"<CR>
    nnoremap <Down>  :echoe "Use j"<CR>
    " ...and in insert mode
    inoremap <Left>  <ESC>:echoe "Use h"<CR>
    inoremap <Right> <ESC>:echoe "Use l"<CR>
    inoremap <Up>    <ESC>:echoe "Use k"<CR>
    inoremap <Down>  <ESC>:echoe "Use j"<CR>
    ```
    

## Extending Vim

There are tons of plugins for extending Vim. Contrary to outdated advice that you might find on the internet, you do *not* need to use a plugin manager for Vim (since Vim 8.0). Instead, you can use the built-in package management system. Simply create the directory `~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/`, and put plugins in there (e.g. via `git clone`).

Here are some of our favorite plugins:

- [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim): fuzzy file finder
- [ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim): code search
- [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree): file explorer
- [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion): magic motions

We’re trying to avoid giving an overwhelmingly long list of plugins here. You can check out the instructors’ dotfiles ([Anish](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles), [Jon](https://github.com/jonhoo/configs), [Jose](https://github.com/JJGO/dotfiles)) to see what other plugins we use. Check out [Vim Awesome](https://vimawesome.com/) for more awesome Vim plugins. There are also tons of blog posts on this topic: just search for “best Vim plugins”.

## Vim-mode in other programs

Many tools support Vim emulation. The quality varies from good to great; depending on the tool, it may not support the fancier Vim features, but most cover the basics pretty well.

## **Shell**

If you’re a Bash user, use `set -o vi`. If you use Zsh, `bindkey -v`. For Fish, `fish_vi_key_bindings`. Additionally, no matter what shell you use, you can `export EDITOR=vim`. This is the environment variable used to decide which editor is launched when a program wants to start an editor. For example, `git` will use this editor for commit messages.

## **Readline**

Many programs use the [GNU Readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) library for their command-line interface. Readline supports (basic) Vim emulation too, which can be enabled by adding the following line to the `~/.inputrc` file:

`set editing-mode vi`

With this setting, for example, the Python REPL will support Vim bindings.

## **Others**

There are even vim keybinding extensions for web [browsers](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_key_bindings_for_web_browsers) - some popular ones are [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en) for Google Chrome and [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) for Firefox. You can even get Vim bindings in [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/lambdalisue/jupyter-vim-binding). Here is a [long list](https://reversed.top/2016-08-13/big-list-of-vim-like-software) of software with vim-like keybindings.

## **Advanced Vim**

Here are a few examples to show you the power of the editor. We can’t teach you all of these kinds of things, but you’ll learn them as you go. A good heuristic: whenever you’re using your editor and you think “there must be a better way of doing this”, there probably is: look it up online.

### **Search and replace**

`:s` (substitute) command ([documentation](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace)).

- `%s/foo/bar/g`
    - replace foo with bar globally in file
- `%s/\[.*\](\(.*\))/\1/g`
    - replace named Markdown links with plain URLs

### **Multiple windows**

- `:sp` / `:vsp` to split windows
- Can have multiple views of the same buffer.

### **Macros**

- `q{character}` to start recording a macro in register `{character}`
- `q` to stop recording
- `@{character}` replays the macro
- Macro execution stops on error
- `{number}@{character}` executes a macro {number} times
- Macros can be recursive
    - first clear the macro with `q{character}q`
    - record the macro, with `@{character}` to invoke the macro recursively (will be a no-op until recording is complete)
- Example: convert xml to json ([file](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/files/example-data.xml))
    - Array of objects with keys “name” / “email”
    - Use a Python program?
    - Use sed / regexes
        - `g/people/d`
        - `%s/<person>/{/g`
        - `%s/<name>\(.*\)<\/name>/"name": "\1",/g`
        - …
    - Vim commands / macros
        - `Gdd`, `ggdd` delete first and last lines
        - Macro to format a single element (register `e`)
            - Go to line with `<name>`
            - `qe^r"f>s": "<ESC>f<C"<ESC>q`
        - Macro to format a person
            - Go to line with `<person>`
            - `qpS{<ESC>j@eA,<ESC>j@ejS},<ESC>q`
        - Macro to format a person and go to the next person
            - Go to line with `<person>`
            - `qq@pjq`
        - Execute macro until end of file
            - `999@q`
        - Manually remove last `,` and add `[` and `]` delimiters

## Exercises

1. Complete `vimtutor`. Note: it looks best in a [80x24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100) (80 columns by 24 lines) terminal window.
2. Download our [basic vimrc](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/files/vimrc) and save it to `~/.vimrc`. Read through the well-commented file (using Vim!), and observe how Vim looks and behaves slightly differently with the new config.
3. Install and configure a plugin: [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim).
    1. Create the plugins directory with `mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start`
    2. Download the plugin: `cd ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start; git clone https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim`
    3. Read the [documentation](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim/blob/master/readme.md) for the plugin. Try using CtrlP to locate a file by navigating to a project directory, opening Vim, and using the Vim command-line to start `:CtrlP`.
    4. Customize CtrlP by adding [configuration](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim/blob/master/readme.md#basic-options) to your `~/.vimrc` to open CtrlP by pressing Ctrl-P.
4. To practice using Vim, re-do the [Demo](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/#demo) from lecture on your own machine.
5. Use Vim for *all* your text editing for the next month. Whenever something seems inefficient, or when you think “there must be a better way”, try Googling it, there probably is. If you get stuck, come to office hours or send us an email.
6. Configure your other tools to use Vim bindings (see instructions above).
7. Further customize your `~/.vimrc` and install more plugins.
8. (Advanced) Convert XML to JSON ([example file](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/files/example-data.xml)) using Vim macros. Try to do this on your own, but you can look at the [macros](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/#macros) section above if you get stuck.
