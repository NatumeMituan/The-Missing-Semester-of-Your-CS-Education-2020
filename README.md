# The Missing Semester of Your CS Education (2020)
[The course website](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).

Notes in this repo are based on the [lecture notes](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/) and the [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyzOVJj3bHQuloKGG59rS43e29ro7I57J). Doing some rearranging and summarizing to the notes if that helps me understand better, but most of the content is just copy-and-paste.

There are also **some** exercises solutions of mine.
